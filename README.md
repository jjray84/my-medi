# My Medi

## Description
With more and more people throughout the U.S. and the world being put on prescription medications, this application is geared towards those who have multiple medications that are sometimes difficult to keep track of when doctors are constantly changing prescriptions and dosage.      
     
This application is geared towards those who would usually carry around a pad of paper with all of their medications written down on and scratched out making it hard to keep track of all of their personal medications.

## How to Use the Application
When you open the application, you will be presented with a login screen.  If you have not created an account yet, you may select the create an account option. Once you are signed up, login in, and you will be presented with a few options that are all clearly defined for ease of use.  You may select Add a new Medication, where you will be presented with a simple form where you can input the name of a medication, the dosage amount, and what the medication is used to treat.  (This is important because some medications can be used to treat multiple illnesses.) The user will also have option to edit personal information such as phone number, emergency contact information including name and phone number, Blood Type, known allergies, any transplants you may have had, as well as any implanted devices such as a pacemaker or port.
